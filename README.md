# ✨ Generative Text Model

A basic generative text model built using deep learning techniques. This project demonstrates how neural networks can generate human-like text after training on a given corpus.

## 🚀 Features

- Character-level text generation
- Built with TensorFlow and Keras
- Simple, editable Jupyter Notebook
- Trains on custom text data

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
